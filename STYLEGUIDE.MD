## General Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project. If you're modifying existing code, try to match the style of the surrounding code.

- **Indentation**: Use spaces for indentation, not tabs. Use two spaces for HTML and CSS, and four spaces for JavaScript.

- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters where possible for improved readability.

- **Comments**: Use meaningful comments to explain complex code sections or provide context. Keep comments concise and up to date.

- **Descriptive Naming**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and IDs/Classes in HTML/CSS.

## HTML

- **Structure**: Follow a clear and organized HTML structure, including proper indentation.

- **Semantic Elements**: Use HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) where appropriate to improve accessibility and SEO.

- **Attribute Order**: Keep HTML attributes in a consistent order for readability. Common order: `class`, `id`, `name`, `src`, `alt`, etc.

## CSS

- **Selectors**: Use meaningful and concise selectors. Avoid overly complex selectors that target multiple elements.

- **IDs and Classes**: Use IDs sparingly and prefer classes for styling. IDs are typically reserved for unique elements.

- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation and formatting in your CSS. Separate rules with a single line of space for readability.

- **Comments**: Comment CSS sections when necessary to provide context for complex styles.

## JavaScript

- **Semicolons**: Use semicolons to terminate statements consistently.

- **Variable Declaration**: Declare variables using `let` or `const` appropriately. Avoid using `var`.

- **Function Declaration**: Prefer function expressions over function declarations. Use arrow functions for concise anonymous functions.

- **Braces**: Use braces `{}` for code blocks, even for single statements.

- **Whitespace**: Use consistent whitespace to improve code readability. Place spaces around operators and after commas.
